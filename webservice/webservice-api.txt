Please notice: All API calls require an HTTP Authorization header. The header is expected to look like this:

  Authorization: Basic <string>

where <string> is a base64-encoded string in the format <username>:<password>.

Additionally, to distinguish between different account roles, the client must provide a special header like this:

  X-ASEPART-Role: <role>

where <role> can be either Admin or User.
